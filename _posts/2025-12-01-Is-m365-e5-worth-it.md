Recently I presented at the Arizona Technology Summit on Microsoft 365 E5.

We went through Is M365 E5 worth it?

The answer...

Yes—if you use it. E5 delivers real value when you adopt what you own and focus on security and productivity outcomes.
Do this next:

Know your situation: renewal coming, new capabilities available, and pressure to realize value.
Prioritize adoption: start with Identity and Security features.
If you’re buying 2+ add‑ons, consider bundling to reduce spend.

Last week I shared a bit about a recent presentation, lets continue building on that. To understand if M365 E5 is worth the cost, we also covered from Microsoft's perspective, what even is M365 E5.

M365 combines: 
 - Microsoft 365 Commercial cloud
 - Enterprise Mobility + Security (Entra & Intune)
 - the cloud portion of Windows
 - per‑user services like Power BI, Security & Compliance, Copilot, plus Exchange, SharePoint, and Teams

It’s Microsoft’s “AI‑powered business and productivity platform.”

If you have these building blocks, are you actually using them? Let’s map capability to need for your organization.

Cost is always the most complex aspect of answering is M365 E5 worth it.

💰 A major component of understanding if the value is worth the cost is very specific to your organization.

List pricing shows M365 E5 & Teams = $721 per user/year, with notable savings vs. stacking separate add‑ons (e.g., O365 E5, E5 Security/Compliance, Defender, Power BI, Teams Phone). 

ℹ️ Keep in mind: when you need multiple premium capabilities, bundle.

Do this next:
 - Compare your current a‑la‑carte stack to the M365 E5 bundle.
 - Create 2-3 personas to right‑size licenses.
 - Use renewal cycles to consolidate vendors.

Want a quick ROI check? Reach out and we can model your mix.

Move from E3 to E5 by layering capabilities:
 - Access & Endpoint management (Entra, Intune).
 - Data labeling & protection for documents and collaboration.
 - Defender suite: EDR, CASB, UEBA; add Insider Risk and IGA/ILM as needed.
 
🏆 Outcome: Better protection across identities, devices, data, and apps—plus BI, calling, and collaboration security.

Let’s sequence your rollout to deliver quick wins.

Over the last few weeks we covered a lot about determining if M365 E5 is worth it.

Now we are in a major change period.

Enterprise Agreement volume level pricing changes this month. Use this window before your next renewal to optimize bundles and consolidate tools.

Work with our team at Sentinel Technologies to run targeted workshops (Modern Identity, Zero Trust, M365 Adoption) and leverage services for projects, managed support, and Defender operations.

Lets work together to help your organization realize the most value from M365, Microsoft, and more.
