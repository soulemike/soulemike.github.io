# Overview of Defender for Servers Capabilities

I have been working on some content for a new presentation that is coming up. One of the components is around Defender for Servers, which is a fairly nuanced topic and gets confusing, especially when clients are looking to fully embrace Microsoft's threat protection model.

If you have ever seen Aaron Dinnage's M365 Maps, then you will immediately see they inspired this concept.

There are lots of goodies packed into these bundles and worth understanding beyond just gaining the EDR capabilities. I will link to the GitHub Gist in the comments where you can view the diagram and where each box has a click through link to the Microsoft documentation.

Building on this post from yesterday. I also put together a visual representing the many hot topics associated with Microsoft Azure Arc.

There is so much value in these tools, and if you work in infrastructure and operations these are the tools you need to be comfortable with in any cloud or hybrid environment.
